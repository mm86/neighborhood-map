Overview:

OutDoors is a map built using JavaScript's Knockout framework, Google Maps API, Yelp API and Weather API. 
You can dynamically search for a list of places to visit such as parks, gardens, zoos and aquariums by entering
your address/zip code. 

How to run the map:

1. Download or clone the files and open index.html. 
2. Enter the zipcode/address of your desired location.
3. You can filter the list using the filter bar. The button in the filter bar is used for toggling the list.
4. Clicking on each location will animate the respective markers and display a snippet of the location's description/review.
5. The T button in the filter box is used for toggling the list. This can be helpful while using the app on a mobile device.
